And lately, it has been really difficult for me to maintain this course and my exams at the same time. Even after this, I am still delivering and I do understand how to code by reading documentations. So, I believe I've got the potential to become one of the <span className='text-info'>best web developers.</span> So for now, my goal is to be the best in batch 5 and then try to reach to my full potential and stand among the <span className='text-info'>bests.</span> And I believe if one really want something and work tirelessly to get it, he eventually does. So that's exactly what I'm going to do, I will turn my life upside down to stand among the bests and I will not rest until I make it happen
